# XSS Scanner Tool

## Introduction
The XSS Scanner Tool is a Python script designed to identify Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. It automates the process of injecting various XSS payloads into input fields and forms, then analyzes the responses to detect potential security flaws. This tool is useful for security professionals, penetration testers, and developers to assess the security posture of web applications and mitigate XSS risks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Requests library (install using `pip install requests`)
- BeautifulSoup library (install using `pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- Colorama library (install using `pip install colorama`)

## Installation
